This project for the Raspberry Pi uses inexpensive HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors as inputs and turns them into keys 
on a MIDI keyboard. There's something pretty neat about using sound to make sound. It's like fighting fire with 
fire, but much safer!

This project has featured on blogs from [The Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/ultrasonic-piano/),
[Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/04/21/ultrasonic-pi-piano-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/), and [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/22/ultrasonic-raspberry-pi-piano/)!

This repository contains documentation for creating your own Ultrasonic Pi Piano, but you can also buy kits 
from the [Makers Grove Tindie Store](https://www.tindie.com/products/andygrove73/ultrasonic-pi-piano/).
